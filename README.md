# psp-font 0.0.1
### A bitmap font library for PSP using the PSP's internal font (firmware PGF and BWFON files)
**Rust version of intraFont_universal by mrneo240**
****
The original intraFont library was made by BenHur on http://www.psp-programming.com/benhur

The intraFont library that made this possible was a fork by mrneo240 on https://gitlab.com/HaydenKow/libintrafont

#### Currently, psp-font only supports PGF font files that are provided by the developer.

### psp-font is currently under very heavy development.
